    "This is a _Jupyter Notebook_. It is a collection of text cells formatted in markdown, and Python code cells. It is designed for interactive exploration. \"Focus\" passes from cell to cell, either by placing your cursor in the next cell or pressing `Shift+Enter`. You don't have to execute markdown cells, but you do need to actively proceed past them. However, don't skip code cells; they often define variables and functions that are required later.\n",

    "## Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental aspect of biological systems is their unbounded ability to exhibit _interesting_ behaviour—behaviour that is neither quite predictable, nor fully random. We always find domains of order and disorder interleaved. This is not by accident: the ability to balance order and disorder, or identity and adaptation, is a defining property of life. We call such systems _complex_.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is a _complex system_? I define it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A complex system has interacting parts which collectively display emergent behaviour that is both irreducible and unpredictable.**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Behaviour is irreducible if it cannot be derived from a simple superposition of its parts.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Behaviour is unpredictable if future states cannot be fully predicted from current states, due to dynamical instability or computational undecidability.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Typically, the parts exhibit context-dependent properties, maintain persistent interactions, and form feedback loops.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Such systems are generally self-describing and often adaptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamical instability can arise through many mechanisms, but very often they involve feedback. A well-studied model of feedback is the \"logistic map\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Model of Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it called the logistic map?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"logistic\" comes from the 19th-century mathematician Pierre François Verhulst, who proposed the logistic equation to model population growth when resources are limited. If one models this in discrete time steps (this is what we call the \"logistic map\") the biological interpretation is preserved: a population grows by a constant factor in each generation (this is called geometric growth) but its total size is constrained by limited resources. The word \"map\" refers to the mathematical concept of iterating a function over and over again: each generation is \"mapped\" to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic map is defined by a _recurrence relation_. (This is the name we give to a function that is applied over and over again to its output at each step.):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{n+1} = r \\cdot x_n \\cdot (1 - x_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $x_n$ represents the population (normalized between 0 and 1) at generation $n$\n",
    "- $r$ is the growth rate parameter (typically between 0 and 4)\n",
    "- The term $(1 - x_n)$ represents self-limitation: as the population approaches the _carrying capacity_ of its environment, growth slows\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its apparent simplicity—just one parameter, one quadratic nonlinearity—this equation generates extraordinarily rich dynamics, including period-doubling, chaos, and fractal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical significance: Robert May's insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic map was known since the 1940s, but its profound implications for biology and dynamical systems weren't widely recognized until Robert May's landmark 1976 paper in _Nature_: \"Simple mathematical models with very complicated dynamics.\" ([1976](https://www.nature.com/articles/261459a0)) May, an ecologist, demonstrated that even the simplest nonlinear population models could exhibit chaotic behavior—unpredictable dynamics arising from simple, deterministic rules. This was revolutionary: it showed that randomness in nature might not require external noise but could emerge from the system's own feedback structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "May argued that scientists and students should be taught about these dynamics early, as they fundamentally challenge our intuition about predictability and control in biological and physical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it significant?\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic map is significant for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Universality**: Period-doubling routes to chaos appear across vastly different systems: fluid dynamics, electrical circuits, chemical reactions, heart rhythms, neural networks, metabolic networks, embryonal development, ... and the logistic map captures universal features of all of these.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Simplicity meets complexity**: With just one equation and one parameter, it produces the full spectrum of dynamical behaviors: fixed points, periodic oscillations, chaos, and self-similar fractal structure. This allows us to use it as a conceptual model in many fields, and ask if similar relationships exist in whatever system we might be studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biological relevance**: It models real phenomena  — population dynamics, genetic drift, neural firing patterns — where feedback and discrete generations are fundamental.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computational undecidability**: Determining long-term behavior from initial conditions can be provably impossible. This connects dynamical systems to fundamental limits of computation and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Feigenbaum constant—a universal number**: As the parameter r increases, the logistic map undergoes period-doubling bifurcations (from period 1 to 2 to 4 to 8...). The physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum discovered in 1975 that the _rate_ at which these bifurcations occur converges to a [universal constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feigenbaum_constants): $\\delta\\approx4.669...$ . Remarkably, this same constant appears in *all* one-dimensional maps with a quadratic maximum, regardless of their specific functional form. It is a universal number, and this universality reveals that there is a deep geometric structure beneath chaos. Radically different systems may follow the same route to complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will introduce and explore the logistic map and compare systems with and without self-limitation, we will visualize emergence and we will see how simple feedback mechanisms can generate the kind of unpredictable, adaptive, complex behavior that characterizes living systems. Finally pose a deeper question: what's special about this map that makes it behave in this way?\n",

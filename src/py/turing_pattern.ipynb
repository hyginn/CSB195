    "# Turing Pattern Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter _notebook_ computes and plots a [**Turing pattern**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern), named for [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), one of the pioneers of computer science, who first described reaction-diffusion systems and realized their importance to analyze large-scale shape organisation in biological systems ([Turing, 1952](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.1952.0012)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of your cat's stripes. They appear on a centimetre scale in the fur. However the individual cells that are responsible for their pigmentation are a million times smaller, and even the organized hair follicles may number more than a thousand across the width of the stripe. How do they know when to produce pigment, and when not to? This is a self-organized system, that needs no central authority to direct the cells: the patterns arise from the diffusion of molecules, their reaction, and decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [reaction-diffusion mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system) produces large-scale spatial patterns through the interaction of an _activator_ and an _inhibitor_. The activator promotes its own production (positive feedback) as well as that of the inhibitor, while the inhibitor suppresses the activator. Crucially, the inhibitor diffuses faster than the activator. The difference in diffusion rates destabilizes uniformity and may lead to periodic organization on a scale that is many orders of magnitude larger than the activator and inhibitor itself. Factors that sustain the production of the two are modelled through a \"_feed_\" term, whereas their removal or degradation is modeled by a \"_kill_\" term; together, these shape the dynamic balance between them, in time and space. The emerging patterns can be strikingly complex and evocative.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate such a system below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first code cell sets up your computer and adds python librarties you might be missing. The cell below it computes an actual pattern and plots it. Put your cursor in a cell and hit `shift + enter` tu run it and advance, or `control + enter` to run it and stay in the cell.\n"
